    content: `The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m² where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m² is their height in metres squared.

BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients. BMI is used as a screening tool to identify potential weight problems for adults.

While BMI doesn't measure body fat directly, research has shown that BMI correlates to direct measures of body fat. It's a useful tool for healthcare providers to assess potential health risks associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese.

BMI Categories (WHO Standard):
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25.0 - 29.9
- Obese: BMI ≥ 30.0

Example Calculation:
If you weigh 70 kg and are 170 cm tall:
BMI = 70 ÷ (1.70)² = 70 ÷ 2.89 = 24.2 (Normal weight)

BMI is most accurate for adults aged 18-65 and may not be suitable for athletes, pregnant women, or elderly individuals with high muscle mass or bone density.`,

    content: `Our calorie calculator uses the scientifically-validated Mifflin-St Jeor equation to determine your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). BMR represents the calories your body needs at complete rest, while TDEE includes calories burned through daily activities and exercise.

The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
- Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
- Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161

TDEE is calculated by multiplying your BMR by an activity factor:
- Sedentary (little/no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- Lightly active (light exercise 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
- Moderately active (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
- Very active (hard exercise 6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
- Extremely active (very hard exercise & physical job): BMR × 1.9

Example Calculation:
A 30-year-old woman, 70 kg, 170 cm, moderately active:
BMR = (10 × 70) + (6.25 × 170) - (5 × 30) - 161 = 700 + 1062.5 - 150 - 161 = 1451.5 calories
TDEE = 1451.5 × 1.55 = 2250 calories per day

For weight management:
- Weight loss: Reduce daily calories by 500-1000 calories
- Weight gain: Increase daily calories by 300-500 calories

    content: `BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) represents the number of calories your body needs to perform basic life-sustaining functions like breathing, circulation, cell production, and brain function. It accounts for 60-70% of your total daily calorie expenditure and is the foundation for calculating your total calorie needs.

Our BMR calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation, which is considered the most accurate formula for estimating BMR:

For Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
For Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161

Example Calculation:
A 25-year-old man, 75 kg, 180 cm:
BMR = (10 × 75) + (6.25 × 180) - (5 × 25) + 5
BMR = 750 + 1125 - 125 + 5 = 1755 calories per day

Factors that affect BMR:
- Age: BMR decreases with age (about 2-3% per decade after 20)
- Gender: Men typically have higher BMR due to more muscle mass
- Weight: Heavier people have higher BMR
- Height: Taller people have higher BMR
- Muscle mass: More muscle increases BMR
- Genetics: Some people naturally have higher or lower BMR

2. Miller Formula (1983) - Good for general population
3. Devine Formula (1974) - Widely used in medical settings
4. Hamwi Formula (1964) - Simple and practical

Example Calculation for a 170cm female:
- Robinson: 49 + (1.7 × ((170-152.4)/2.54)) = 49 + (1.7 × 6.9) = 60.7 kg
- Miller: 53.1 + (1.36 × ((170-152.4)/2.54)) = 53.1 + (1.36 × 6.9) = 62.5 kg
- Devine: 45.5 + (2.3 × ((170-152.4)/2.54)) = 45.5 + (2.3 × 6.9) = 61.4 kg
- Hamwi: 45.5 + (2.2 × ((170-152.4)/2.54)) = 45.5 + (2.2 × 6.9) = 60.7 kg

BMI Range Method:
We also provide a BMI-based healthy weight range:
- Height: 170cm
- BMI 18.5-24.9 (healthy range)
- Weight range: 53.5-72.0 kg

    content: `An EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator helps you determine the monthly payment amount for any loan. EMI is the fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month.

The EMI calculation formula combines both principal and interest components:
EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- R = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)
- N = Loan tenure in months

Example Calculation:
Loan Amount: ₹10,00,000
Interest Rate: 12% per annum
Tenure: 5 years (60 months)

Monthly Interest Rate (R) = 12% ÷ 12 = 1% = 0.01
EMI = [10,00,000 × 0.01 × (1+0.01)^60] / [(1+0.01)^60 - 1]
EMI = [10,000 × 1.8167] / [1.8167 - 1]

Example Calculation:
Monthly SIP: ₹10,000
Expected Annual Return: 12%
Investment Period: 10 years (120 months)

Monthly Return Rate (r) = 12% ÷ 12 = 1% = 0.01
