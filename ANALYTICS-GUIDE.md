## üìà Quick Analysis Tips

### **Count Amazon Clicks**
In Google Sheets, use this formula in an empty cell:
```
=COUNTIF(B:B,"*amzn.to*")
```
This counts all rows with Amazon links.

### **Count HeyGen Clicks**
```
=COUNTIF(B:B,"*heygen.com*")
```

### **Count All Affiliate Clicks**
```
=COUNTIF(D:D,"affiliate")
```

### **Most Popular Tool**
```
=MODE(D:D)
```
or create a pivot table to see all tools ranked.

### **Clicks Today**
```
=COUNTIF(A:A,">="&TODAY())
```

## üé® Create a Dashboard (Optional)

### **Method 1: Simple Summary Sheet**
1. Create a new sheet tab called "Dashboard"
2. Add these formulas:

```
Total Clicks: =COUNTA(Sheet1!A:A)-1
Amazon Clicks: =COUNTIF(Sheet1!B:B,"*amzn.to*")
HeyGen Clicks: =COUNTIF(Sheet1!B:B,"*heygen.com*")
Tool Clicks: =COUNTIF(Sheet1!D:D,"<>affiliate")-COUNTIF(Sheet1!D:D,"")
```

### **Method 2: Pivot Table**
1. Select all data in your tracking sheet
2. Go to **Insert > Pivot table**
3. Add **Tool Name** to Rows
4. Add **COUNTA of Timestamp** to Values
5. This shows you which tools/links are most clicked

## üí° What Each Row Tells You

| If Tool Name = | Then User Clicked... |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `affiliate` + Link has `amzn.to` | Amazon product (check Link URL to see which one) |
